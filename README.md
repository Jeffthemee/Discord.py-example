How do I get my bot token?


In order for this code to work, you need to put in your discord bot token, if you don't know how to get a discord token listen up. 
First you are going to need to make a discord app, to do this head over to https://discord.com/developers/applications and click the "new application" button
once you do that you should see a box promting you to type in a name, I recommend putting what you want your bot to be named here just because it makes it easir to find. 
Once you do that go the the "bot" catagory then press the button named "add bot", then press the buttion labled reset token(NOTE: if you have 2fa enabled it may prompt you for 
a code) once you do that you should be able to copy and past the bot token <3
